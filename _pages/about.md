I am a undergraduate in Computer Science at Stanford University, with a focus on natural language processing and information retrieval. My research explores multimodal retrieval, ranking algorithms, and low-resource languages. I am particularly interested in improving how models retrieve and process information from diverse data sources, including text, video, and multilingual content.
