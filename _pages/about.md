I am a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University, advised by Eugene Yang and Benjamin Van Durme. I collaborate with people in the Center for Langauge and Speech Processing and the Human Language Technology Center of Excellence. Previously I did my Bachelors and Masters in Computer Science at Stanford University, where I worked with Omar Khattab and Chris Potts, and was advised by Mehran Sahami.
